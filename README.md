# Memory-Saver
In every computer memory is very precious. I have designed an application where it will take a file as an input and compress its size.
If you want to decompress it again, even that option is available.
User will get GUI where they can select any of the 2 options, whether they want to compress or decompress.
I have made this using JAVA Swing and NetBeans IDE.
